1. ST_NumPoints
Output - the count of this Geometrys vertices
Apporch - Used getNumPoints

2. ST_NumInteriorRings
Output - Returns the number of interior rings of a polygon geometry
Apporch - Used getNumInteriorRing if instance of polygon

3. ST_NumGeometries
Output - Returns the number of Geometries in a GeometryCollection
Apporch - Used getNumGeometries

4. ST_GeometryN
Output - Returns an element Geometry from a GeometryCollection for a index specifying geometry element.
Apporch - Used getGeometryN

5. ST_IsRing
Output - Test if Geometry is ring
Apporch - Checked if Geometry is multiline or line and used isSimple and isClosed which represents the ring

6. ST_Difference
Output - Points contained in one Geometry that are not contained in the other Geometry. The return type is a geometry 
Apporch - Used difference

7. ST_SymmetricDifference 
Output - points in one Geometry which are not contained in the other Geometry, with the points in the other Geometry not contained in this Geometry 
Apporch - Used symDifference
